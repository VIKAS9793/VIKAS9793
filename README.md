# ⚙️ Vikas Sahani — AI-Native Builder | ML System Designer | BSc Botany + Finance

👋 Hi, I'm Vikas — a BSc graduate in Botany with 4+ years in finance, now building AI-native solutions to solve domain-aligned problems. I design explainable, offline-first AI systems by combining deep learning engineering practices with real-world awareness.

I'm not from a CS background — but I build like an engineer. Using tools like Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, and ChatGPT, I've transitioned from finance into deploying practical AI solutions that help people, not just impress recruiters.

## 🚀 Flagship Project: [KrishiSahayak+Gemma](https://github.com/VIKAS9793/KrishiSahayak_Gemma)

> 🌾 **A 100% offline, production-ready agricultural AI assistant** — engineered for Indian farmers in low-connectivity regions, combining Google's Gemma 3n model with RAG architecture, running on ≤2GB RAM Android devices.

### 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

| Component | Technology Stack | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **AI Engine** | `google/gemma-3n-E2B-it` (quantized to q4_k_m.gguf) | Core language model for agricultural diagnostics |
| **Knowledge Base** | FAISS + SQLite + CSV pipeline | RAG system for factual grounding |
| **Web Interface** | Gradio + FastAPI | Rapid prototyping and demonstration |
| **Mobile App** | Native Android + C++ (llama.cpp) | Production deployment for end-users |
| **Data Strategy** | Phased approach: Generic MVP → Regional Data Packs | Scalable, expert-curated content |

### 🎯 Engineering Highlights

**Two-Track Development Strategy:**
- **Track 1**: Web-based prototype using transformers library (maximum quality demonstration)
- **Track 2**: Native Android app with quantized model (offline-first production)

**Production-Ready Features:**
- 🔄 **Phased Data Strategy**: MVP with generic dataset → Production with expert-curated Regional Data Packs
- 📱 **Resource Optimization**: Runs on low-end Android devices (≤2GB RAM)
- 🌐 **Offline-First**: Zero internet dependency, P2P distribution (SD card, local sharing)
- 📊 **Multi-Modal Input**: Text, voice, and image processing
- 🎯 **Regional Focus**: Initially targeting 6 pilot states in India

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Phase 1: ✅ Asset Production (Model quantization, data pipeline, validation)
Phase 2: 🟡 Android MVP Development (Current)
Phase 3: 🔄 Field Testing & Pilot Deployment
Phase 4: 🚀 Continuous Improvement & Scaling
```

⚙️ **Status**: Production-Track Development • Multi-Modal • RAG-Enhanced • Offline-Optimized
