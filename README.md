# ⚙️ Vikas Sahani — AI-Native Builder | ML System Designer | BSc Botany + Ex-Finance

👋 Hi, I’m Vikas — a BSc graduate in Botany with 4+ years in finance, now building AI-native solutions to solve domain-aligned problems. I design explainable, offline-first AI systems by combining deep learning engineering practices with real-world awareness.

I’m not from a CS background — but I build like an engineer. Using tools like Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, and ChatGPT, I’ve transitioned from finance into deploying practical AI solutions that help people, not just impress recruiters.

## 🚀 Flagship Project: [KrishiSahayak](https://github.com/VIKAS9793/KrishiSahayak)

> 🌿 **An offline-first, explainable AI system for detecting crop diseases** — built fully solo, combining RGB+NIR multi-modal deep learning, GAN-based enhancement, Grad-CAM transparency, and ONNX deployment.

🧩 **System Architecture Overview**  
| Layer                    | Stack / Tools                                    | Location                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Loader**          | Albumentations, stratified split, YAML config    | `src/data/`               |
| **Model Architecture**   | EfficientNetV2, BaseModel, RGB+NIR fusion        | `src/models/`             |
| **GAN for NIR**          | Pix2Pix, synthetic enhancement                    | `src/models/gan/`         |
| **Training Framework**   | PyTorch Lightning, seed reproducibility          | `train.py`, `src/config/` |
| **Explainability**       | Grad-CAM overlays with modular hooks             | `src/explainability/`     |
| **Deployment**           | ONNX export, CLI inference, fallback logic       | `run_inference.py`        |
| **Packaging**            | Poetry, pre-commit, Ruff, pyproject.toml         | Root                      |

⚙️ **Status**: PoC-ready • Modular • Transparent • Offline-first • Solo-built

## 🔍 What Makes KrishiSahayak Stand Out?

> KrishiSahayak is **not** just another AI demo. It’s a grounded, modular, and explainable system — solving a real problem, for real users.

| ❌ Typical AI Portfolios         | ✅ **KrishiSahayak**                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| LLM wrappers or chatbot demos    | Multi-modal deep learning with GANs + fusion     |
| Cloud dependency                 | Offline-first, ONNX optimized, CLI deployable     |
| Black-box predictions            | Grad-CAM explainability for transparency          |
| No real-world use case           | Built for marginal farmers with no internet       |
| Prompt-only assembly             | Modular architecture, reproducible pipelines      |
| No engineering principles        | Config-driven, type-safe, pre-commit, YAML-based  |

> “This project wasn’t built to vibe — it was built to validate that even solo builders, with domain knowledge and the right tools, can deliver meaningful AI.”
